    <p><strong>Re:public Ed</strong> is a new coalition forming in Connecticut to bring about educational excellence in our public schools.</p>

    <p>Historically known for its excellence, Connecticut’s public education system now faces many challenges. Given that Connecticut has one of the widest wealth gaps in the country, it is perhaps not surprising that the state is currently home to the country's widest education gap between rich and poor.</p>
      
    <p>Corporate education reformers, downplaying the wealth-opportunity connection, have used their standardized tests to argue that poorer public schools are failing and should be replaced. Many of our political leaders have accepted this message and its means of assessing schools. They have responded by outsourcing public education to private corporations, funded with public tax dollars. This and similar strategies, in the name of "education reform," have not improved the quality of education for Connecticut students from low-income communities.</p>

    <p>Re:public Ed is currently inviting board of education members, parents, teachers, and others who want to ensure quality public education for all, to join us in collectively bringing about educational excellence in Connecticut.</p>

    <p>Re:public Ed believes Connecticut can re-establish educational excellence in Connecticut by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Providing all our children with the opportunities that cutting edge science indicates are critical for learning:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Access to the arts</li>
          <li>Time for play and physical activity</li>
          <li>Experiences in the world beyond their own immediate context</li>
          <li>Engagement with diversity of all kinds as an asset for learning; and opportunities to discover and develop their own talents and skills, and to experience a sense of pride in their accomplishments.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Halting the school-to-prison pipeline by: replacing racially and ethnically discriminatory and punitive disciplinary practices like suspension and expulsion with more effective, restorative practices that improve children's social skills and relationships and enhance their learning.</li>
      <li>Ensuring public education funding is equitable throughout Connecticut and sufficient for robust art, music and physical education programming.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Re:public Ed is committed -- through research, network development and community education initiatives -- to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Advancing effective school policies based on the science of how children learn</li>
      <li>Identifying and promoting strategies that equalize opportunities for all students regardless of socioeconomic status, race or ethnic group</li>
      <li>Making available to Boards of Education peer-reviewed research and rigorously vetted resources that can inform education policy decisions and ensure those decisions enhance children’s learning</li>
      <li>Connecting and equipping policy makers, families and community members to act collectively to strengthen public education in Connecticut and to push back against corporate and political efforts to privatize public education</li>
    </ol>
